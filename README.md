### Problem Statement: Cost and Resource Optimization for LLM Agents

**Objective:** Develop a system to optimize costs and resource usage for LLM agents.

---

## Tasks

- Implement cost tracking and analysis systems
- Develop resource optimization algorithms
- Create tools for cost-benefit analysis and optimization recommendations

---

## Expected Outcome

A cost optimization system that helps reduce operational costs while maintaining performance.

---

## Progress

- Researched open-source LLM cost-optimization tools (e.g., LiteLLM, GPTCache) and built a comprehensive solution combining their features with custom optimization strategies.

- Components were independently developed and validated by team members; system-wide integration is pending.

---

## Pending Work

- Low-level integration of all components into a single production-ready pipeline.
- Create a Middleware SDK that will allow others to use this solution in their systems.

---

## Blockers

- Limited experimentation with multiple LLM providers due to API quotas and rate limits.
- Need for end-to-end benchmarking to quantify actual cost reduction.
- Fine-tuning thresholds (cache similarity, batching wait time) using real traffic data.
